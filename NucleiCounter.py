    """
    The class for object which performs marked nuclei counting.
    This is a part of the general model for obtaining target percentage.
    The objects of this class are not to be used explicitly - they function
    inside of the general Model class defined further.

    Input params are:
    - threshold value for nuclei image binarization;
    - eps param for DBSCAN algorithm;
    - min_samples value for DBSCAN algorithm.

    Output value is the number of marked nuclei detected.
